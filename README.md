Title: J.S.W.A.T - JavaScript Web Application Template

Description: A custom JavaScript web application template utilizing various technologies and libraries.
J.S.W.A.T makes it easy to incorporate full stack application technologies if a simple front-end application isn't required. 
A complete project folder structure is set up with both "Frontend" & "Backend" directories within the main "Application" directory.
A few other resources are included like .gitignore, config.env, README.md, Documentation.md, Licence.md, a package.json which holds a template to the basic dependency collection J.S.W.A.T utilizes and an application_main.js file as the server entry point. Links to documentation and guides are specified below in the "Docs" section for extra insight.

Tech Stack: Node.js for the backend & EJS(Embedded JavaScript) for the frontend. 

Dependency Stack: cors, dotenv, morgan, body-parser, nodemon

Frameworks/Libraries/Dependancies Utilized: Bootstrap.css, jQuery, ,
